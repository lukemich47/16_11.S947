# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Make a Chart

This week, we are running through the basics of mapping with D3! Our exercise this week is going to involve creating a map, adding data, and then interaction using a time slider. We will then show a number of examples, and introduce the concepts of working with projections, TopoJSON, choropleths, and tabular data.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you will want to do is grab a current copy of the repo from Github. You can simply download the ZIP to make it easy. In here, you will find data and code examples for the exercises.

2. Start up a localhost python server in the directory that contains your examples and data folder. This is where we will do our visualization design and coding.

3. Find the in-class exercise at:

This page will contain the tutorial for the week. We are going to make a map using javascript and D3 methods!

4. The take-home problem set (PSET8_sliderMap) is found at the following in this weeks folder.
